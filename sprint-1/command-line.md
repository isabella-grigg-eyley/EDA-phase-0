how would you describe the command line to a lay person (e.g. your mum)?

- The command line is a place where you can interact with the system and files without using a graphical interface (i.e. using a mouse, buttons, etc.) Instead you write instructions directly. 

List 10 terminal commands and describe what they do.

- pwd: print working directory (tells you what folder you're in)
- cd: change directory (move to a new working folder)
- cp: copy a file
- mv: move or rename a file
- mkdir: make a new directory/folder
- rmdir: remove a directory/folder
- less: page through a file (opens the file to read separately to the rest of the command line and presents it page by page. w/s or arrow keys to move through each page, q to exit)
- cat: display the contents of a file inside the command line
- grep: search a file for specific expressions and returns lines that match
- exit: close the terminal
