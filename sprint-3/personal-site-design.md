- What is your site's primary purpose?
    To convey my learning process during my time at Dev Academy.
- Who is your target audience?
    Dev Academy tutors and other EDA students.
- How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?
    Ideally I'd like them to find it easy to find specific blog posts, organised by type (cultural, technical). Uncluttered design. If it could convey something about who I am as a person too, then that would be great. I'd like the header to contain links to my other blog posts.
- How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?
    I'll have navigation links in the header so users can easily find other sections of the website. I'll also have a "next blog post" and "last blog post" link at the bottom of each post so users can continue through them without having to navigate back and forth. I'd also like the design to be fun and creative- bright and interactive. (But not slow! There were a lot of websites that looked cool but ran slowly and I want to avoid that as it ruins the whole experience of using them.)
